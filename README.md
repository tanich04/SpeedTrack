# SpeedTrack

**SpeedTrack** is an advanced AI-powered project that leverages the powerful combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and DeepSort (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for real-time object tracking and speed estimation. Designed for efficiency and accuracy, SpeedTrack is perfect for applications in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and sports analysis.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizing YOLO's state-of-the-art detection capabilities to identify multiple objects in real-time.
- **Precise Object Tracking**: Employing DeepSort for reliable tracking of object movements across frames.
- **Speed Estimation**: Calculating the speed of moving objects with high accuracy.
- **Event Logging**: Logging events with timestamps, object details, and movement direction.
